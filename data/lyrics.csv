26,Bag of Porn Lyrics,
27,Barclays Rant Lyrics,"I got off the phone with this one dude. I guess he used to run a multi-billion dollar company or something like that and he had some advice for me, right. He said, 'I don't approve of your methods in your interviews lately.' He said he only saw one person before who ever really pulled this off and that was Muhammad Ali. But he said if he could just give me some advice, he doesn't approve of the way I'm going about things as of late. And when anybody that's supposed to have a lot of money talks to me and they give me advice, I call that free advice, because they're trying to tell me what to do and they ain't cut no check yet. If I look to the side of me, or the other side of me, or if I look to the Internet or if I'm reading, and I don't see somebody that 36-years-old that made it this far with nobody that told they couldn't do it this much. Because the people that give me advice... I don't see them rocking for 15,000 motherfuckers in Brooklyn tonight. And I don't know if y'all have heard of [Nikola] Tesla, and I'm not talking about the car, I'm talking about the inventor. Or if y'all ever heard about [Alejandro] Jodorowsky, the director who made Holy Mountain. But there's so many amazing creative inventors who weren't recognized in their time. And if I've got the voice and I've got the opportunity to turn up in these interviews, I just have to look and say, 'What do I have to lose?' What do I have to lose? We only have everything to gain. So don't ever let them make you think for one moment that I'm going insane. Because I sit back and see shit and think 'Am I the only one that's not crazy?' But every celebrity is so goddamn scared of losing everything, that they won't ever say nothing to you. And y'all see that shit too. I gotta keep it so true for you... Because when I say 'creative genius,' I'm not saying that as a compliment to myself. I'm saying that because it's a burden to myself when these ideas keep me up at night. When you wanna give the world more and your ideas keep you up at night. When you wanna give the world so much more, so much more. And then nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. And nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. They'd rather see the headline and be on some bullshit than to give me one little chance. Than to give me one little, little, little chance. Than to give me one little chance despite the advance out of Tesla's basement, despite the advance out of me saying Jodorowsky's name and ya'll don't know who the fuck he is when everybody copied off of him... And there's gonna be motherfuckers in this arena in a few months dancing all sloppy off of him...I love y'all so much you don't even understand. Because y'all help me to talk all this shit. Because when I be on the phone with these people that used to run companies and they're trying to tell me how to be me, y'all give me the power to talk my shit. And I swear to you, this is only the motherfucking beginning. And anybody who [says], 'Oh, he's the best of rap.' That's racist. And that's pigeonholing. That's pigeonholing. That's pigeonholing and putting motherfuckers in a box. And putting creative niggas in a box. If you believe you can do anything, please raise your hands up tonight. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands in the sky. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands so high. And I wish you could see my tears right now. Put your hands up high. I wish you could feel my pain right now. Cause these dreams keep me up at night. Cause these dreams keep me up at night. These dreams keep me up at night. Dreams keep me up at night."

185,Hot 97 Lyrics,"Malice found religion, Tony found prison|-|I'm just tryna find my way out this f-cking kitchen|-|a birdseye view got me channelling my vision|-|turn one to two now my kilo's got a sibling|-|father knows best, watch my hands are forgiven|-|we kicking up dust like the colosseum floors|-|walls full of safe's like they mausoleum doors|-|getting wet like she walking through my morgue|-|Grant's, Jackson's no room for George|-|yeh, the fear of God's in you muthaf-ckers|-|this art imitate my life|-|you WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation white|-|eliminate the fools ghouling imitation ice|-|my music for your soul, inspiration for your life|-|every dime made in his life more disastrous|-|help my young n-ggas see my way through the bachelors|-|while my old b-tch went back to get her Masters|-|same graduation I was clapping in the rafters|-|the truth hurts everytime it's revealed|-|what goes around comes around, this is lights ferris wheel|-|grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parrallel park|-|Kentucky derby on the grill|-|the fact that I'm free lets me know God is great|-|ten year marathon of me selling concentrate|-|these rappers talk crowns but I'd rather talk fear|-|villian like candyman, say my name and I'll appear|-|no weapon formed against me shall prosper|-|a kuna matata, feet up sipping java|-|strolling up the totem poll, what's my only problem|-|scrolling through my Rolodex, who show up my toddler|-|so many hands raised as the band plays|-|I'm here now, watch how many plans change|-|Penitentiary chances, the devil dances|-|and eventually answers to the call of Autumn|-|all of them fallin' for the love of ballin'|-|got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin|-|inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums|-|based off the way we was branded|-|face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon|-|and at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random|-|but we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage|-|I need a happy ending and a new beginning|-|and a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative|-|and sold your dreams, you don't know who did it|-|i treat the cash, the way the government treats aids|-|I won't be satisfied til all my n-ggas get it|-|I need more drinks and more lights|-|hot American Apparal girl in just tights|-|she told the director she tryna get in a school|-|told to take them glasses off and get in the pool|-|it's been a while since I watched the tube|-|its like a crip said: ""I got way too many blues for any more bad news""|-|I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today|-|they rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday|-|what's a black beetle anyway, a ...roach|-|I guess thats why they got me sitting in f-cking coach|-|but God said I need a different approach|-|cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke|-|it aint funny anymore try dipping jokes|-|tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o|-|kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I'm got it|-|play strings for the dramatic|-|and end all of that wack shh|-|act like I aint had a belt in two classes|-|I aint got it I'm going after whoever who has it|-|I'm coming after whoever who has it|-|you blowing up, that's good, fantastic|-|that y'all, its like that ya'll|-|I don't really give a f-ck about it at all|-|cause the same people that tried to black ball me|-|forgot about 2 things, my black balls|-|Uh, I let you into my diary to admire me|-|the making of this man, I let you see the higher me|-|the self righteous drug dealer dichotomy|-|I'm drawing from both sides, I'm Siamese|-|the tug of war opens the door, entrada|-|rip me apart and see what's inside this pinata|-|and rolling kilos in gym(?) is one saga|-|one chapter of black magic, I'm Harold potter|-|feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women whom|-|relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom|-|and blossom, I swear this Vegas nights was awesome|-|but adios I blow my own dice before I toss 'em, loss 'em|-|some other muthaf-ckers double crossed 'em|-|tryna snatch my n-gga back I blew a small fortune|-|Russell with the work, we was like the four horsemen|-|Rick Flair with the flame, I'm muthf-cking Gorgeous, woah|-|as the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smtih|-|whiter than the coke brush that they paint me with|-|sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss|-|but the devil red, tires double tread|-|I'm posting parks up. that gets me double head|-|tight rope walking tryna keep a level head|-|the bright lights blind look what the devil did|-|yeah|-|It's hip hop, this is euphemism for a new religion|-|the soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing|-|this is more than just my road to redemption|-|Malcolm West had the whole nation standing to attention|-|as long as I'm in Polo's they think they got me|-|but they would try to crack me if they ever saw a black me|-|I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me|-|if a n-gga aint running shootin a jump shot running a track meet|-|but this pimp is, on the top of mount Olympus|-|ready for the Worl's game, this is my Olympics|-|we make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish|-|choke a southpark writer with a fishstick|-|and I assisted to get up offa this d-ck|-|and these drugs, fans cant resist it|-|remember, remind of when they tried to have Ali enlisted|-|if I ever one of the greatest homie, I must have missed it!|-|Wow, they both went in!!!"

190,I Feel Like That Lyrics,"While you're fast asleep, do you experience nervousness or shakiness inside, weakness or dizziness? The idea that so much can control your thoughts. Lost in your thoughts. Trouble remembering things, feeling easily annoyed and irritated. Afraid of open spaces, going in public. Thoughts of ending your life. Feelings that most people could not be trusted before I had that type of heart, chest pains?|-|I feel like this|-|I feel like that|-|I feel like that|-|I feel like that all the time|-|I feel like that|-|I feel like that|-|I feel like that|-|Feel like that all the time|-|Do you feel tempered outbursts, that you cannot control? Feeling lonely, even when you are with people, feeling locked. Feeling a little sad, feeling disinterested in things, feeling fearful. Are your feelings easily hurt? Remember that people are unfriendly, or do you feel like people dislike you?|-|I feel like that|-|I feel like that|-|I feel like that|-|I feel like that all the time|-|I feel like that|-|I feel like that|-|I feel like that|-|Feel like that all the time|-|Do you have trouble falling asleep? Nausea, upset stomach, pop those pills? Numbness, tingling across your body, trouble catchin' your breath?|-|I feel like that|-|I feel like that|-|I feel like that all the time|-|I feel like that|-|I feel like that|-|Feel like that all the time"

I don't know what to tell you about him, I love him so much with all my heart and my soul with every bone in my body I love him so much because he's done so much for me.|-|Every morning, every day of my life. I won't always be crying tears in the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up by myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day. I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do and how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it, how I'm gonna get there, because he... he's gonna be there for me. Some day the sky above will open up and he will reach out his hand and guide me through, oh yes he will. I won't always be crying these tears. I won't always be feeling so blue. Some day, he will open up the door for me and call my name. Some day he will. I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like.|-|No matter what you've been through or where you've been he's always there, with his arms open wide accepting me for who I am and I love him so much, I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to. I'm crying now, it feels so good to be free, to be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what, oh lord thank you, you are the joy of my life."

321,Speech at Harvard Graduate School of Design Lyrics,"So after walking through here I decided that I wanted to make sure for anyone that didn't have tickets tonight that you all could have tickets to the show. So anybody who wants to come tonight, you can have tickets for the entire office!|-|But I just wanted to tell you guys: I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to actually be ""architected."" And this is the reason why even some of the first DONDA employees were architects that started designing t-shirts instead of buildings. But just to see the work actually be actualized.|-|If I sit down and talk to Oprah for 2 hours, the conversation is about realization, self realization, and actually seeing your creativity happen in front of you. So the reason why I turn up so much in interviews is because I've tasted what it means to create and be able to impact, and affect in a positive way.|-|And I know that there's more creativity to happen. And I know that there's traditionalists that hold back the good thoughts and there's people in offices that stop the creative people, and (who) are intimidated by actual good ideas.|-|I believe that utopia is actually possible-but we're led by the least noble, the least dignified, the least tasteful, the dumbest, and the most political. So in no way am I a politician-I'm usually at my best politically incorrect and very direct. I really appreciate you guys' willingness to learn and hone your craft, and not be lazy about creation.|-|I'm very inspired to be in this space. Tonight, this show, if you come see it-um, I'm a bit self conscious because I'm showing it to architects. So the stage does have flaws in it. It's an expression of emotion so give me a pass on that. And that's basically all I have to say so thank you very much."
